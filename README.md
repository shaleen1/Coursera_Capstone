### Coursera Capstone Project
This is a project in which I have analyzed universities in the United States by clustering them by their academic statistics and nearby venues. The dataset I used is from the IPEDS Data Center, which allowed me to modify the attributes and download the data as a CSV file.

### Guide
-Preprocessed CSV with all attributes and samples: <i>uni_data.csv</i>

-Jupyter Notebook with all code including analysis and clustering: <i>university_project.ipynb</i>
#### Note: please paste the notebook link in this site to see the maps: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

-Final CSV with only attributes being academic cluster/profile and venue cluster/profile: <i>unis.csv</i>

-Final CSV with all relevant attributes: <i>clustered_unis.csv</i>

-Report (Please read this to understand my process) <i>report.pdf</i>




I have applied an MIT License, so please feel free to explore, enhance, expand, or otherwise contribute to this project. It is my hope that prospective university students can use an enhanced version of my idea to find suitable matches based on their college preferences.
