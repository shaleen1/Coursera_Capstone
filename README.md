### Coursera Capstone Project
This is a project in which I have analyzed universities by clustering them by their academic statistics and nearby venues. 

### Guide
-Preprocessed CSV with all attributes and samples: <i>uni_data.csv</i>
-Jupyter Notebook with all code including analysis and clustering: <i>university_project.ipynb</i>
##### Note: please paste the notebook link in this site to see the maps: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
-Final CSV with only attributes being academic cluster/profile and venue cluster/profile: <i>unis.csv</i>
-Final CSV with all relevant attributes: <i>clustered_unis.csv</i>
-Report (Please read this to understand my process) <i>report.pdf</i>


Please feel free to enhance this project. It is my hope that prospective university students can use an enhanced version of my idea to find suitable matches based on their college preferences.
